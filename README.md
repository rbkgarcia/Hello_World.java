# Overview

  This is my first program in Java. I'm trying to accomplish  
  an understanding of this language to develop myself as a  
  Web developer. Learning Java is a goal I have set to  
  further improve my abilities and learning.  
  
  This program prints "Hello World"  

  The purpose of creating this software was to practice  
  creating a Java class with the main method used to allow  
  the instruction to print the message.

# Development Environment

  This program was built using JAVA SE 17, with The JDK as the development environment.  
  Also, I used the IntelliJ IDEA as IDE to facilitate de coding and compiling of Java.  
  Lastly, I used the git tools of IntelliJ and GitHub to create a version control of my program and the repository of my Java program.

  Java is an object-oriented language, that is, Java works with its data as objects.  
  To carry out the coding for this program I had to define a class. This class contained the method main, used to start the execution of the program, in this case, the printing of the message.  
  To run the Java code it is necessary to compile the Java program to an intermediate language (called bytecodes) independent of the machine for its execution. This intermediate language is interpreted by the Java interpreter, called the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This was done through the IDE IntelliJ.
